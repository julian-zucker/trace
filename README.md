# TRACE

After every course you take at Northeastern, you get badgered to fill out the TRACE (Teacher Rating and Course Evaluation) survey. But student's don't really get any value out of it. Sure, you can view the data on TRACE's byzantine website, if you like waiting 20 seconds for each course to load, and you only want to look at one course at a time, but that doesn't do anyone much good. I wanted to be able to compare courseload for multiple courses, and compare professor quality so that I could get the most out of each class, but there was no easy way to do that. So I made one.
